# HarvOS ‚Äî A Secure Harvard-Architecture Operating System & CPU

HarvOS is a research concept for a **secure, minimalistic operating system and processor design** that prioritizes *trustworthiness over raw performance*.  
It introduces a novel combination of **Harvard separation**, **MMU**, and **MPU**, aiming to make entire classes of software exploits *structurally impossible*.

---

## üîë Key Features

- **Strict Harvard Separation**  
  Instructions and data exist in physically separate memory spaces.  
  No possibility of executing data as code.

- **MMU + MPU (Dual-Layer Protection)**  
  - MMU: Enforces per-process isolation, virtual memory, W^X, and ASLR.  
  - MPU: Global physical region protections (e.g., RAM is non-executable forever).  

- **Immutable & Verifiable Boot**  
  OS core stored in ROM/EEPROM, verified at startup.  
  Secure A/B updates supported.

- **Exploit Mitigations by Design**  
  - **W^X everywhere**  
  - **ASLR**  
  - **Stack canaries**  
  - **Guard pages**  
  - **No speculative execution attacks**

- **Microkernel OS Architecture**  
  - Only scheduling, IPC, VM, and traps in kernel mode.  
  - Drivers, filesystems, and services run in user space with *capabilities*.  

- **Deterministic Performance**  
  - In-order pipeline, bounded latencies, no speculation.  
  - Suitable for embedded + server workloads.

- **Formal Verifiability**  
  ISA, CSRs, and MMU/MPU invariants expressed in formal semantics.  
  Enables proof-carrying code and model checking.

## üìú Whitepaper

A full technical whitepaper (~100 pages) is available in the repo under  
[`docs/HarvOS_Whitepaper.pdf`](docs/HarvOS_Whitepaper.pdf).  
The log of the ChatGPT session which did produce the whitepaper
[`docs/ChatGPT Log HarvOS Design.pdf`](docs/ChatGPT+Log+HarvOS+Design.pdf).  


It includes:
- Instruction semantics with pseudocode
- CSR bitfield tables
- Formal MMU/MPU invariants
- Example security policies
- FPGA prototyping path
- Comparison vs. x86 / ARM / RISC-V / AVR
